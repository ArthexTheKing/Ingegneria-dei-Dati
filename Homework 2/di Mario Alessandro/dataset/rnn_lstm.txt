Recurrent neural networks process sequential data such as text and time series.
Traditional RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradients.
LSTM and GRU architectures improve memory handling, allowing better sequence modeling.
RNNs are used in speech recognition, language modeling, and sentiment analysis.
