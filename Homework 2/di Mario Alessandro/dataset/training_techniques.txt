Deep learning training relies on gradient descent optimization.
Backpropagation computes gradients layer by layer to update network parameters.
Techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and weight initialization improve convergence and generalization.
Proper training requires tuning learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization strategies.
