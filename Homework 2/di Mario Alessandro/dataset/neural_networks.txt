A neural network is composed of interconnected neurons organized in layers.
Each neuron transforms its input using learnable weights and activation functions.
Training a neural network involves adjusting weights using gradient descent and backpropagation.
Neural networks can approximate complex, non-linear functions and solve tasks such as classification and regression.
