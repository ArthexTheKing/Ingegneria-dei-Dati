Training deep learning models requires large labeled datasets.
Popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, COCO, and LibriSpeech.
Dataset quality and diversity significantly impact model performance and generalization.
Data augmentation techniques expand training data and help prevent overfitting.
