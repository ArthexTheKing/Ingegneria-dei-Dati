Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel.
Attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input context.
Transformers outperform RNNs in machine translation, text generation, and question answering.
Popular models include BERT, GPT, T5, and Vision Transformers for images.
