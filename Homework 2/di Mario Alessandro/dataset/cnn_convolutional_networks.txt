Convolutional neural networks are widely used for image classification and object detection.
CNNs use convolutional layers to extract spatial features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions, improving efficiency and robustness.
Popular CNN architectures include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet.
